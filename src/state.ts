// Per-render-pass context threaded through Scene.render/Node.render, ported
// from python/state.py: the active camera/device/renderPass, the pipeline
// stack, a per-group bind-group stack (see pushBindGroup/popBindGroup -
// used by Material/TextureSet), and a flat named-value stack per
// "matrix"-group field name (fed by Transform, read by
// Shader.commitMatrix - see pushMatrix/popMatrix/getMatrix).
// "material"/"global"/textures don't go through this value-stack at all -
// each Shader owns its own persistent per-Material buffers, its own
// "global" buffer, and its own per-TextureSet bind groups.
// The "matrix" field name is a stack too, but accumulates via pushMatrix
// instead of a plain push; vertex/normal/projection are derived from it
// once per Node, via loadMatrices/unloadMatrices.
//
// The camera's view/projection matrices are computed once here, not per-
// Node: one State is built fresh per render pass, and the camera is
// logically constant for its whole duration.
